description: row of the samples.csv, representing full list of genome_ids with associated fasta files in raw data directory

type: object

# columns that the config/samples.csv file can have and which type they should be
properties:
  genome_id:
    type: [string, number]
    description: genome id with genome version, same as fasta files stored in data/raw/fasta/ directory
  
  source:
    type: string
    enum: [custom, ncbi, patric]
    description: source of the genome to be analyzed choose one of the following-'custom', 'ncbi', 'patric'
    # custom  : for provided in the data/raw/fasta directory with genome ids as filenames
    # ncbi : for list of public genome accession IDs that will be downloaded from the NCBI refseq (GCF...) or genbank (GCA...) database
    # patric: for list of public genome accession IDs that will be downloaded from the PATRIC database
  
  organism:
    type: [string, null]
    description: name of the organism that is same as in the fasta header
  
  genus:
    type: [string, null]
    description: genus of the organism. Ideally identified with GTDBtk.
  
  species:
    type: [string, null]
    description: species epithet (the second word in a species name) of the organism. Ideally identified with GTDBtk.
  
  strain:
    type: [string, number, null]
    description: strain id of the organism

  closest_placement_reference:
    type: [string, number, null]
    description: the closest NCBI genome to the organism. Ideally identified with GTDBtk.
